# carzone_django

Carzone Django is a web application developed using the Django framework that allows users to buy and sell cars online. The application is deployed on GitHub, which means that the source code is open and available for anyone to view and contribute to.

The application has a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for cars based on various criteria, such as make, model, year, price, and location. Users can also create an account, add their cars to the platform, and manage their listings.

The application has several features that make it a convenient platform for both buyers and sellers. For example, sellers can upload images of their cars, set a price, and receive notifications when someone expresses interest in their car. Buyers, on the other hand, can save their favorite listings, compare different cars, and contact sellers directly through the platform.

Overall, Carzone Django is a well-designed and functional application that provides a simple and effective way for users to buy and sell cars online. With its open-source nature, it has the potential to grow and evolve over time with contributions from the community.
